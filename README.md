# FriendlyChat
Firebase SDK 3.x is a little different from 2.x, but the [sample code](https://github.com/firebase/friendlychat) of [Firebase iOS Codelab Swift](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/firebase-ios-swift/#0) didn't update to 3.x.  
This repo coded in Swift 3.1, updated to newest Firebase SDK with cocoapods.   
Furthermore, some improvement on UI and Privacy access request.
